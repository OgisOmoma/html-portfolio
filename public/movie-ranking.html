<h1>The Best Movies According To Ogis</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies/Series of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3> 
<p>this is one of my favourite series, very inspiring</p>
<h3>Straight Outta Compton</h3>
<p>This was one of my best movies growing up, it tells a story about the hard core gangsta rap culture</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>This movie potrays a black hustler who made it out of the hood dealing drugs and all sort of businesses and he was tierd of that life style because he now has a family, so he was looking for a way out.</p>
